# Prediction-of-Evaporation-using-Linear-Regression

### Description
The purpose of this project is to create a statistical machine learning model to predict evaporation in a 25kmx25km area in Ethiopia using net radiation, wind speed, dew point temperature, and air temperature. Dew point temperatureis used as a measure of humidity in the atmosphere. A Linear regression model is used for training. The data used for this project was collected from Era 5:https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5.

### Python libraries used in this projet:
1. Xarray
2. Sklearn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Numpy
6. Statsmodels

### Instructions
You need to install the python library packages listed above and download the correspondig input files.

The respository contains all the codes used to display visualizations and analysis.
