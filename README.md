# Prediction-of-Evaporation-using-Linear-Regression

### Description
The purpose of this project is to create a statistical machine learning model to predict evaporation in a 25kmx25km area in Ethiopia using net radiation, wind speed, dew point temperature, and air temperature. Dew point temperatureis used as a measure of humidity in the atmosphere. A Linear regression model is used for training. The data used for this project was collected from Era 5:https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/datasets/reanalysis-datasets/era5.

### Python libraries used in this projet:
1. Xarray
2. Sklearn
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib
5. Numpy
6. Statsmodels

### Instructions
To run this code you need to first install Xarray. You might need to uninstall matplotlib first as that might cause errors while you try to read the files. Once you have installed all the above libraries you can run the code for the analysis models.

The respository contains all the codes used to display visualizations as well a work on the analysis.
